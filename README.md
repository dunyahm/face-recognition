## Face tracking and detection with webcam

Playing with an example repurposed from [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) for hackweek.

To start:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Browse to http://localhost:3000/.

Go to /admin page to upload up to 2 images with a name label for the face recognition to work. Then go back to the main page, and click on identify me. 

This example is modified to only use the Tiny Face Detector and the webcam directly. All other non-related code has been reduced and removed. For the full examples, visit the face-api.js library itself.
